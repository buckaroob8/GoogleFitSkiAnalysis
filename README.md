# Google Fit Ski Analysis

The Google Fit app collects some detailed movement data, but it doesn't present a view tailored to the activity, in this case downhill skiing.  I wanted to see top speed for runs at least, and to remove distance traveled while on the lifts. My excuse or doing this is that I've never really worked with XML before so it's a minor learning experience there as well.

Some goals for the project:
* Show elevation and speed on a graph
* Remove data from while on the lift and adjust total distance
* Color code each run and show on map (well, maybe just in a blank rectangle, not a full map)
* Animate through the runs on the map showing current speed/elevation on dashboard

Screenshot so far:
